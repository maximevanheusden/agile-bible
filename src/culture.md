# Agile is culture based

To be able to execute Agile working well, a certain culture is needed. An Agile culture is characterized by trust, open communication, daring to experiment, and continuously learning and improving. A lot of value is attached to teamwork and sharing knowledge and experiences.

We find that Agile principles work best in self-organising, multidisciplinary teams in which all of the individuals take ownership of their work.
