# The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto was found in 2001 by a group of individuals, after analysing the pitfalls of the counter - waterfall development method.

# The Goal

The goal is to deliver working software as quickly as possible that meets the customer's requirements. An important characteristic of Agile working is the flexible way of working. Instead of working with long and elaborate plans, the Agile team works with short iterations of one to four weeks. During these iterations, a certain part of the project is worked on. After the iteration, the result is shown to the customer, and it is evaluated what went well and what can be improved. In this way, continuous adjustments are made, and changes are quickly responded to.

# Core Values of Agile Software Development

* Individuals and interactions *over* processes and tools
* Working software *over* comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration *over* contract negotiation
* Responding to change *over* following a plan

# The 12 principles of Agile

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 
* Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
* Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# Why Agile

Agility is a mindset, not a methodology. The idea is that every team chooses a set of conventions to follow in the development process. There are some frameworks that find their origin in the Agile Manifesto, like Scrum. However, this is still a framework that needs to be filled in into detail by each individual team as the needs of the team depend on the size and scope of the project.
