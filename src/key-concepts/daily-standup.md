# Daily Stand-up

The daily meeting, also known as the daily stand-up in Scrum. Each day at the same time, the team meets so as to bring everyone up to date on the information that is vital for coordination: each team members briefly describes any “completed” contributions and any obstacles that stand in their way.

# Benefits

* the daily meeting prevents a common failure mode of teams, where in the absence of an explicit occasion to share recent information, some critical knowledge may sometimes “fall through the cracks”
* regular peer-to-peer sharing of information in a short, focused and energetic meeting also contributes to team cohesion
* stand-up meetings are reliably shorter, more pleasant and more effective than sit-down meetings. So get that ass up and running!
